            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Clyde Charles Coelho </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Mangalore, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently pursuing MCA at St. Joseph Engineering College Mangalore. 
            I have completed my BCA degree in at St. Aloysius College
            Mangalore.
            I am a dedicated and passionate Full-Stack Developer with a strong background in building and maintaining modern web applications. With a solid foundation in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), I specialize in creating scalable, high-performance web applications that deliver exceptional user experiences. From crafting intuitive front-end interfaces to developing robust back-end systems, I enjoy the challenge of bringing innovative solutions to life
            My skill set includes designing responsive user interfaces, optimizing database performance, and building secure, RESTful APIs. Iâ€™m always seeking to enhance my knowledge, stay current with emerging technologies, and refine my coding practices.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, here are some other activities that I love to do!
